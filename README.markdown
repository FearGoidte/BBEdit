# BBEdit settings

Some of the clippings and scripts that are lurking in the `Application Support` folder for my [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) installation.

Locally, I’m using the rather fetching [‘BB Edit Icon’](http://www.softicons.com/folder-icons/isuite-revoked-icons-by-prax-08/bb-edit-icon) icon by [PraX-08](http://www.softicons.com/designers/prax-08) for my folder.

You are free to with or without as you please. Where content has been shamelessly filched from elsewhere, I have tried to note the fact.

## Automatic non-breaking spaces text filter

Implemented Anton Bryl’s [`poemnobr.pl`](http://blog.epubbooks.com/898/formatting-poetry-for-small-screens) script as a text filter for automatically inserting non-breaking spaces between.

## GitHub flavoured Markdown preview

I have reformatted and optimized [Gavin Aiken](https://github.com/gavinaiken)’s [Github Flavored Markdown parser and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets" class="initialism">C.S.S.</abbr> for BBEdit](https://github.com/gavinaiken/bbedit-scripts) styles out of habit rather than utility.

The parser is used when [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files are previewed using BBEdit rather than a browser.
