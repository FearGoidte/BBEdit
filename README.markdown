# BBEdit settings

Some of the Clippings and scripts that are lurking in the `Application Support` folder for my [BBEdit]() installation.

Locally, I’m using the [‘BB Edit Icon’](http://www.softicons.com/folder-icons/isuite-revoked-icons-by-prax-08/bb-edit-icon) icon by [PraX-08](http://www.softicons.com/designers/prax-08) for my folder.

You are free to with or without as you please. Where content has been shamelessly filched from elsewhere, I have tried to note the fact.
